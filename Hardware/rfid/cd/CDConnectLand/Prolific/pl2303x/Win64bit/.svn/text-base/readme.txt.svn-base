================================
Known Limitation:
---------------------------
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition HyperTerminal Issue

Symptom:
----------------
The data transfer rate of PL-2303 is very slow when using the new HyperTerminal (5.2.3790.1830) program in Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Version 2003 Service Pack 1. 

Cause & Workaround:
---------------------------------
The PL-2303 uses software control to simulate Serial COM port, so the driver needs to send more data in each BulkOut command. However, it seems that the newer version of HyperTerminal (v5.2.3790.1830) in Windows XP Professional x64-Edition is using other method in sending data byte by byte that limits the PL-2303 driver to achieve the transmit rate set by users. 

When using an older version of HyperTerminal (v5.1.2600.0) from Windows XP SP2 (32-bit Version 2002), the data transfer is normal. Prolific is trying to feeback this issue to Microsoft if the HyperTerminal program in Windows x64-bit Edition could be updated. 

Prolific advices not to use the HyperTerminal program (v5.2.3790.1830) in Windows x64-Edition until this limitation is resolved. Prolific recommends to use an older version of HyperTerminal or use other software programs.
