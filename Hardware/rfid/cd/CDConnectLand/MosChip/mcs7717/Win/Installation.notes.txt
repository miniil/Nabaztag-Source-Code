5. Removing Previously Installed Drivers
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes it will be desirable or even necessary to remove the previously installed 
drivers, so that a new, clean installation can be performed. Drivers can get 
corrupted when being written to their installation medium (CD-ROM etc.). If this 
happens, the drivers may not install properly.Even if the installation proceeds 
without errors, the drivers may not work. Sometimes older outdated drivers are 
shipped with a product. Newer machines may require newer updated drivers, but the 
older drivers prevent them from being installed. The easiest way to remove old 
drivers is to use the MosUPortUninst.EXE program (located in WINNT\System32 
directory or in the Installation disk supplied with the product). 


Using MosUPortUninst.EXE to remove old Drivers

    a. Unplug the USB Compound device. 

    b. Open Start->Settings->ControlPanel->Add/Remove Programs.
